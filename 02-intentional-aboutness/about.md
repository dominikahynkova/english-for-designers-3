## Tereza Smitkov√°

Beginning designer with a sense of creative thinking, obsessed with preciseness and simplicity of artwork. 

I am Tereza love my family, friends, and especially my cat (my animal soul-made). I believe I am a reliable, responsible, empathetic, and friendly character with a sense of humor. My passion is visiting cafes, finding a good meal, and discovering new beautiful places. In design, I am a person, who prefers simplicity and purity of artwork, but sometimes I like a little bit of extravagance. My inspiration is a saying: Beauty lies in simplicity.
