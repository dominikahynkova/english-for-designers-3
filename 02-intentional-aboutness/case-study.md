The connecting element for the visual identity is the grid - symbolizes movie windows/screen, where takes place stories.
The grid means the system of Europe. The colors and illustrations define the diversity of India.

It is possible to create stories for a different genre of movies (characteristic icons). For a romantic film is a woman, man, love. For a thriller is a gun, robbery, bomb.

People can be part of the festival via Instagram or Facebook. They can create their own stories, invent funny captions. For example Romeo, I am waiting for you, where are you (you can see in the first picture).
