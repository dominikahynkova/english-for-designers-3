## Bollywood festival

Last semester we were given a brief for a new visual identity of the existing festival.
I was working on the identity with my classmate Eliska Safarova. I think this is one of the best work I have ever created.

Bollywood Festival celebrated 18 years old - imaginary adulthood, this year. The task was to create a design, which could represent topics - adulthood, majority, a mix of Czech, and Indian culture. The festival organizes a non-profit organization Bollywood z.s., headed by writer and director Radim Špaček.
