## Tereza Smitková

Beginning designer with a sense of creative thinking, obsessed with preciseness and simplicity of artwork. 

I grew up in Ústí nad Labem. I love my family, friends, and especially my cat (my animal soul-made). I believe I am a reliable, empathetic, and friendly character with a sense of humor. My passion is baking, visiting cafes, and discovering new beautiful places. In design, I am a person, who prefers simplicity and purity of artwork, but sometimes I like a little bit of extravagance. My inspiration: Beauty lies in simplicity.
