## Bollywood festival

Last semester we were given a brief for a new visual identity of the existing festival. I was working on the identity together with my classmate Eliska Safarova. I think this is one of the best work I have ever created.

Bollywood Festival celebrated 18 years old - imaginary adulthood, this year. The task was to create a design, which could represent topics - adulthood, majority, a mix of Czech, and Indian culture. The festival organizes a non-profit organization Bollywood z.s., headed by writer and director Radim Špaček.

The design of the Bollywood Film Festival needed to unite visual identity, that would be playful, colorful, easy to remember, and recognizable. devise a marketing strategy to make the festival more famous among people. Better communication via social networks. Making new promotion and gift items. Also, make an idea of visual for next year (creating a connecting element).

In the first step, we researched for the Bollywood Film Festival to find out more information. We looked for how they worked with design in recent years. We also started brainstorming, wanted to write keywords that describe India, the festival, the movies. On Pinterest, we looked for inspiration on how other designers work with visual style at other Indian film festivals. Then we created a moodboard - what colors we will use, what style we could create illustrations (playful,colorful). We defined our connecting element, which we could use in the following years - the grid - and create the concept of the visual identity of the festival. Our goal was to create a story in each of the window - illustrations - which are interconnected and can be combined in various ways, thus creating new stories. After we drew the sketches, we started working on graphics programs. We worked on illustrations in Procreate on a tablet, used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for mockups and promotions, and Aftereffects for animations - we wanted to show that we created illustrations that are on the move- as if you were watching a movie at a festival.

### Our language

We also created an alternative custom language based on Indian proverbs. The language characterizes mysterious India. These proverbs make you think and lead to a smile. Also, that is a part of the visual and marketing communication in posters, and especially on social media. 

### Promotion

Our visual style of stories allows people to become part of the festival on social networks via Instagram and Facebook. They can create their own story, join illustrations, and come up with funny captions. And so, thanks to these posts, the festival can quickly become known among the people.
For example: Romeo, I am waiting for you, where are you? (you can see in the first picture). Also is possible to make a ticket game or a puzzle for the movie.
